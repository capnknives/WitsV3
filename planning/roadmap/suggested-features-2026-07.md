# WitsV3 — Suggested Features & Roadmap

**Last updated:** July 8, 2026 (Phase 0 complete — `main` promoted)  
**Working branch tip:** `cursor/work` / `claude/work` (merge into `fix/revive-2026-07` or `main`)  
**Test suite:** **571 passed, 2 skipped** (July 8, 2026 — re-run `pytest -q` before claiming green)

This is the **canonical forward roadmap**: what to add, improve, or remove next.  
For **what already shipped**, see [`revival-2026-07.md`](revival-2026-07.md) and the root [`README.md`](../../README.md).  
For **Top 50 Local AI feature mapping** (has vs gap), see [`local-ai-50-gap-analysis-2026-07.md`](local-ai-50-gap-analysis-2026-07.md).  
For audits (clutter / tools / config), see the July 8 catalog docs in this folder.

### Git workflow

Feature work → **`fix/revive-2026-07`** or feature branches → **`main`** after verification.  
Richard promoted **`fix/revive-2026-07` → `main`** July 8, 2026 (Phase 0 complete).

## 1. Gates before `main` promotion

Human verification, not code tasks.

| # | Action | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| G1 | ~~Manual tests A–F~~ | ✅ DONE July 8 2026 — see revival / composer handoff notes |
| G2 | Optional: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Ask-Claude only — still open, owner's call |
| G3 | ~~Document Q&A grounded answers~~ | ✅ DONE July 8 2026 |

**Already done:** Tavily/Brave keys (when available), WCCA JSON repair, MCP follow-ups, Tier 4 splits, G1/G3.

---

## 1a. Coding agent & self-repair — SHIPPED July 8 2026

Summary of what landed (detail also in README § Self-repair):

- Shared pipeline: `core/safe_code_editor.py` (snapshot → write → pytest → commit or restore)
- Tools: `diagnose_log_errors`, `run_test_suite`, `apply_code_fix`, `restart_app`
- Agents: real `SelfRepairAgent` + coding agent disk writes / verified file fixes
- Schedule: in-process daily cron + BackgroundAgent parity (`self_repair` task **disabled by default** in `config/background_agent.yaml` so running Docker bg + main app does not double-fire)
- Path-guard fix on `write_file`; control-center specialized-agent routing fix

**Honest follow-ups (not blocking):**

- Full-file LLM rewrite (diff/patch path would scale better for large files)
- Log diagnosis needs real Python tracebacks (bare ERROR lines stay non-actionable)
- Restart is still blunt `Popen` + exit (fine for CLI/dev; not a graceful uvicorn drain)
- `restart_after_fix` defaults **off** so scheduled runs never interrupt a live session

---

## 2. Post–Top-50 roadmap (July 8, 2026)

Mapped against [`FEATURE_IDEAS/Top Local AI System Features.docx`](FEATURE_IDEAS/Top%20Local%20AI%20System%20Features.docx) — detail in [`local-ai-50-gap-analysis-2026-07.md`](local-ai-50-gap-analysis-2026-07.md).  
**Score:** 6 full matches · 26 partial · 17 gaps · 4 N/A (hardware/OS).

**Product stance:** WitsV3 is a **personal LAN orchestration stack**, not a full sovereign AI OS. Do not chase voice, fine-tuning, microVM sandboxes, or Windows ODR unless requirements change.

### Phase 0 — Ship gate ✅ complete (July 8, 2026)

| # | Item | Maps to | Effort | Status |
|---|------|---------|--------|--------|
| 0.1 | Merge `fix/revive-2026-07` → `main` | — | Human | ✅ Done July 8 — fast-forward to `4c676c3` |
| 0.2 | Keep pytest green | — | Ongoing | ✅ **571 passed, 2 skipped** (July 8) |
| 0.3 | Optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for ask-Claude | #18 | Owner | Open — optional; escalation works when key is set |

### Phase 1 — Trust & daily-use quality ✅ complete (July 8, 2026)

| # | Item | Maps to | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | ~~**Conversation-history-aware intent**~~ | #21–22 | Medium | ✅ Done July 8 — WCCA follow-up routing |
| 1.2 | ~~**Guest Phase 3–4 completion**~~ | #27, #43–45 | Medium | ✅ Done July 8 — policy YAML, safesearch, admin UI |
| 1.3 | ~~**Hybrid document search**~~ | #31, #33 | Medium–Large | ✅ Done July 8 — BM25 + vector fuse in `document_tools` |
| 1.4 | ~~**Pre-compaction memory flush**~~ | #22 | Medium | ✅ Done July 8 — flush before history window drops turns |
| 1.5 | ~~**Evidence sufficiency gate**~~ | #33 | Small–Medium | ✅ Done July 8 — synthesis guard blocks weak doc answers |
| 1.6 | ~~**Multi-session chat UI**~~ | #21 | Medium | ✅ Done July 8 — `/api/sessions` + Chats panel |

### Phase 2 — Operator UX & observability **(current)**

**Pre-2.1 polish (July 8 evening):** Chat slash-command picker — type `/` in the composer for a Cursor-style menu (`web/slash_commands.py`, `GET /api/commands`). Role-filtered: guests see `/help`, `/new`, `/export`, `/chats`, `/tools`; owner adds panels, navigation, `/shutdown`, `/restart`.

| # | Item | Maps to | Effort |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 2.1 | Ollama model pull/status helper in `/settings` | #8–9 | Small |
| 2.2 | MCP server health panel (state, last error) | #14, #20 | Small–Medium |
| 2.3 | Tool usage analytics (latency, failures) | #20 | Medium |
| 2.4 | Streaming tool progress in SSE | #20 | Medium |
| 2.5 | Scheduled background tasks UI (read-only) | — | Small |
| 2.6 | Offline / air-gap mode flag (disable web_search + MCP egress) | #6 | Small |

### Phase 3 — Memory depth (pick one path)

| # | Item | Maps to | Effort | Verdict |
|---|------|---------|--------|---------|
| 3a | **Pragmatic:** FAISS default + session memory search in orchestrator | #21, #25, #29 | Medium | Recommended — flip `memory_manager.backend: faiss_cpu` after validation |
| 3b | **Research:** Wire KG into document RAG (light GraphRAG) | #28 | Large | Only if ISO/compliance-style docs become primary use |
| 3c | **Research:** Neural web as product surface | #21, #28 | Large | See [`neural-web-roadmap.md`](neural-web-roadmap.md) — decide before investing |
| 3d | SKILL.md-style orchestrator playbooks | #16 | Medium | Reusable workflows without full agent swarm |

### Phase 4 — Parked (explicitly out of scope)

| Area | Features | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Voice / ambient | #34–37 | No STT/TTS pipeline; huge scope |
| Smart home | #38 | Home Assistant integration |
| Fine-tuning | #46–50 | Training infra ≠ orchestration product |
| Enterprise sandbox | #40–41 | microVM / SEB overkill for personal LAN |
| Windows ODR | #15 | OS-level; MCP registry covers discover |
| Multimodal chat | #11 | Wait for stable local vision models + UX |
| Digital twin / persona emulation | #39 | Sensitive; guest profiles + personality enough for now |

---

## 2a. Legacy priority table (July revival — mostly done)

### P0 — Verify & promote

1. ~~Complete manual tests A–F~~ ✅  
2. ~~Keep the suite green~~ ✅ 571 passed, 2 skipped (July 8, 2026)  
3. ~~Merge `fix/revive-2026-07` → `main`~~ ✅ Done July 8, 2026  

### P1 — High leverage (historical)

| Item | Why | Effort | Status |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| Orchestrator synthesis guard | Ground answers in tool observations | Medium | ✅ Done |
| Friendlier Ollama-down (CLI) | Match web UX | Small | ✅ Done |
| Conversation export UX | One-click export in web UI | Small–Medium | ✅ Done |
| Conversation-history-aware intent | Short replies after a clarifying question misclassified as casual chat | Medium | ✅ Done July 8 (Phase 1.1) |
| **Guest / family tester access** | LAN phone testing without owner token; device identity + safe tool subset | Medium–Large | ✅ Done July 8 — Phase 3–4 complete (Phase 1.2) |
| Expand CI lint | Full ruff/black blocked by legacy noise | Medium (incremental) | ✅ Done July 8 |
| Docs / README modernity | Install + honest status | Medium | ✅ Done July 8 |
| Clutter cleanup wave 1 | Delete orphans + relocate scripts | Small–Medium | ✅ Done July 8 |

### P2 — Structure & hygiene (second-pass splits)

Files still over ~500 lines (excluding archived GUI). Re-measure before splitting — several already dropped after July work:

| Approx. lines | File | Suggestion |
|-------------:|------|------------|
| 735 | `tools/neural_web_nlp.py` | Split NLP ops from helpers |
| 772 | `tools/neural_web_visualization.py` | Split render/export from graph queries |
| 704 | `core/tool_composition.py` | Composition engine vs registry glue |
| 632 | `agents/self_repair_handlers.py` | **Prefer delete** — orphan after rewrite (see clutter catalog) |
| 607 | `core/memory_manager.py` | Backend factory vs segment CRUD |
| ~500+ | `core/neural_memory_backend.py`, `knowledge_graph.py`, `response_parser.py`, … | Split or archive if unused |

**Recently under control:** `enhanced_reasoning.py` split into models/patterns modules; `wits_control_center_agent.py` / `web/server.py` remain manageable.

### P3 — Features (superseded by §2 Phases 1–2)

| Feature | Value | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| ~~Memory browser in web UI~~ | Search + prune | ✅ Done July 8 |
| Multi-session chat history | Named sessions | ✅ Done July 8 (Phase 1.6) |
| Tool usage analytics | Latency / failure rates | **→ Phase 2.3** |
| MCP server health dashboard | State + last error | **→ Phase 2.2** |
| Local model pull helper | `ollama pull` from UI | **→ Phase 2.1** |
| Streaming tool progress | Richer SSE for long tools | **→ Phase 2.4** |
| Scheduled background tasks UI | Visibility into jobs | **→ Phase 2.5** |
| Hybrid RAG | Lexical + semantic | ✅ Done July 8 (Phase 1.3) |

Document upload via web already exists in the UI side panel — prefer polish over a net-new feature.

### P4 — Neural web (only if actively using it)

Wired (tools register; `memory_manager.backend: neural` optional) but not the default path. Decide product vs research before investing. Historical ideas: [`neural-web-roadmap.md`](neural-web-roadmap.md).

## 3. Remove, archive, or simplify

See also [`clutter-catalog-2026-07.md`](clutter-catalog-2026-07.md), [`tool-registry-reality-2026-07.md`](tool-registry-reality-2026-07.md), [`config-surface-truth-2026-07.md`](config-surface-truth-2026-07.md).

| Item | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Adaptive LLM stack | ✅ Archived July 8 → `planning/archive/adaptive_llm/core/` (superseded by `model_router.py`; `test_adaptive_llm.py` + `tests/config.yaml` removed). Root `torch.py` shim deleted |
| Synthetic brain / cognitive cluster | ✅ Archived July 8 → `planning/archive/synthetic_brain/` (`memory_handler`, `cognitive_architecture`, stubs, integration + tests) |
| `planning/archive/gui/` | Keep archived; web UI is the client |
| Supabase | Optional; skip in default install docs |
| Synthetic brain doc set | Historical — entry [`docs/SYNTHETIC_BRAIN.md`](../../docs/SYNTHETIC_BRAIN.md) |
| Root `TASK.md` / `PLANNING.md` | Redirects only |
| `DOCKER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Parked / background-agent only |

### Repo footprint consolidation (July 2026)

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **0 — Safe deletes** | ✅ Done | Removed `models/` (dummy adaptive-LLM safetensors), `WitsV3/` stray package, `enhanced_config_with_fallback.txt`; moved `debug_init.py` + `fix_neural_web.py` → `scripts/` |
| **1 — Doc consolidation** | Pending | Merge `planning/` + `docs/` under single `docs/` tree |
| **2 — Archive slim-down** | Pending | Tag + prune `planning/archive/gui/` etc. |
| **3 — Runtime `var/` layout** | Pending | Centralize paths in config first |
| **4 — Root surface cleanup** | Pending | Instruction-file redirects |

---

## 4. Parked (out of scope unless requirements change)

- Docker packaging as primary deploy path  
- Supabase cloud sync as default  
- PyQt6 desktop GUI revival  
- Git submodules for MCP servers (replaced by on-demand install)  
- Neural web as primary product surface

## 6. Suggested next chunk

1. ~~**Phase 0:** Promote `fix/revive-2026-07` → `main`~~ ✅ Done July 8, 2026  
2. ~~**Phase 1:** Trust & daily-use quality (all six items)~~ ✅ Done July 8, 2026  
3. **Phase 2.1:** Ollama model pull/status helper in `/settings` (start here)  
4. **Phase 2.2–2.6:** MCP health, tool analytics, streaming progress, background-task visibility, offline mode  

**Also shipped (pre-2.1):** Chat slash-command picker — type `/` for help, new chat, export, panels, owner process controls.

Defer Phase 3 (FAISS default / GraphRAG / neural web) until Phase 2 operator UX is in place.

---

*When this doc goes stale: bump the header date, re-run `pytest --collect-only`, and reconcile shipped items against `git log`.*
