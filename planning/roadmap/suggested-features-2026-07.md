# WitsV3 — Suggested Features & Roadmap

**Last updated:** July 7, 2026  
**Integration branch:** `fix/revive-2026-07` @ `14adeed`  
**Staging branch:** `cursor/iron-delta-w0r5` (synced with integration)  
**Test suite:** 337 collected (329 passed / 2 skipped on last full run)

This is the **forward-looking** roadmap: what to add, improve, or remove next.  
For **what already shipped** during the July 2026 revival, see
[`revival-2026-07.md`](revival-2026-07.md). For **manual regression tests**
before promoting to `main`, see
[`composer-orchestrator-search-quality-2026-07.md`](composer-orchestrator-search-quality-2026-07.md)
§ "Suggested manual test plan" (tests A–F).

### Git workflow

All agent/feature work lands on **`fix/revive-2026-07`** first. Richard merges
→ **`main`** after manual testing looks good.

## 1. Gates before `main` promotion

These are **human verification**, not code tasks.

| # | Action | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| G1 | ~~Run manual tests **A–F**~~ | ✅ DONE July 8 2026 — driven live against a dedicated `claude/work` instance (no browser available): A (model routing toggle), B (Ollama-down friendly card, verified via a deliberately-unreachable Ollama URL rather than killing the real service), C (single `web_search` call, numbered sources, grounded answer), D (document upload + question answered via the orchestrator's automatic `search_memory` context injection, not a stray `web_search`), E (107 passed), F (save-to-file wrote a real file with correct USER/ASSISTANT lines). Test residue (uploaded doc, memory segments, exported log) was cleaned up afterward via the real `delete_segments` API. |
| G2 | Optional: add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required only for ask-Claude escalation — still open, Richard's call |
| G3 | ~~Watch logs on document Q&A~~ | ✅ DONE July 8 2026 — verified with an unguessable planted codeword (`ZEBRA-QUASAR-77`) in an uploaded test document; the orchestrator answered correctly, which is only possible if it actually used the retrieved content rather than hallucinating. |

**Already done (no action):** Tavily key, Brave key, Supabase token revoke (N/A — no project),
WCCA JSON repair, MCP follow-ups, Tier 4 splits, G1/G3 manual verification.

## 1a. Coding agent & self-repair — from stub to real (SHIPPED July 8 2026)

**Audit finding (before this work):** both `AdvancedCodingAgent` and `SelfRepairAgent`
were LLM-prose generators with no filesystem/process I/O at all. The coding agent's
"project creation" built a `CodeProject.files` dict from **hardcoded scaffold
template strings**, held only in memory — never written to disk, never compiled,
never tested. Its debugging/refactoring handlers asked the LLM to write a generic
guide as prose. `SelfRepairAgent.run()` was a literal 2-line LLM passthrough: send
the raw user message to the LLM, stream back whatever came out — no log parsing,
no diagnosis, no fix, no verification. The more elaborate `self_repair_handlers.py`/
`self_repair_utils.py` "fix" functions were dead code (never imported by the live
agent) and were themselves simulations (`await asyncio.sleep(0.5); return True`).
Separately, `FileWriteTool` had a real path-guard check in source, but it was
**unreachable dead code** — two full `try/except` blocks back to back, where the
first always returned before the second (which held the only safety check) could
run — so `write_file` had zero enforced path restriction in practice. Process
restart existed (`run.py`'s file-watcher-triggered relaunch) but was off by
default and never invoked by any agent. Scheduling infrastructure was real
(APScheduler + cron config) but lived only in a Docker-only, normally-unstarted
`BackgroundAgent`, with no repair task defined.

**Plan:** build one shared, safety-first verified-edit pipeline and give both
agents (and the tool registry generally) a real detect → diagnose → fix → verify
→ (optionally) restart loop on top of it, then wire a scheduled autonomous run.

**Shipped:**

1. **`core/safe_code_editor.py`** — the shared pipeline every code-writing path
   now goes through: snapshot original bytes → write candidate → run pytest →
   commit to git *only* on a passing verification, or restore the exact original
   bytes (or delete a new file) on failure. A failed attempt never leaves stray
   git state and is never left broken in the working tree. `resolve_within_project()`
   is the one enforced boundary — refuses any path escaping the project directory.
2. **`tools/self_repair_tools.py`** — four new registry tools any agent can call:
   `diagnose_log_errors` (parses `logs/witsv3.log` tracebacks for file/line,
   read-only), `run_test_suite` (pytest wrapper), `apply_code_fix` (the verified
   pipeline above), `restart_app` (deliberately schedules a relaunch a few
   seconds out so the current response can finish streaming first — reuses the
   same `subprocess.Popen` + process-exit pattern as the existing file-watcher
   restart, just triggered on purpose instead of on any `.py` save).
3. **`agents/self_repair_agent.py` rewritten**: if the request names a real
   existing file, targets it directly; otherwise scans recent logs via
   `diagnose_log_errors`. For each actionable issue, reads the file, asks the LLM
   for a full corrected version, and applies it through `apply_code_fix` — verified
   fixes are reported with their commit sha, failed ones report that the file was
   reverted, never silently swallowed. Optional restart after a verified fix,
   gated by `self_repair.restart_after_fix` (default off).
4. **`AdvancedCodingAgent` gets two real capabilities**: project creation now
   writes generated files to `workspace/<project_name>/` and runs `py_compile` on
   each `.py` file, reporting per-file syntax status instead of leaving everything
   as an in-memory string; and a request naming a real existing file (e.g. "fix
   the bug in agents/foo.py") routes straight to a new `_handle_fix_existing_file`
   that reuses the exact same verify-before-commit pipeline as self-repair —
   so "coding agent" and "self-repair agent" share one trustworthy edit path
   rather than two different half-measures.
5. **`FileWriteTool` dead-code bug fixed** — collapsed the two duplicate
   try/except blocks into one, now actually enforced via
   `resolve_within_project()`, with a regression test locking in the fix.
6. **Daily autonomous schedule**: `self_repair.daily_schedule_enabled` (default
   on, cron `0 3 * * *`) runs the scan-and-fix loop from inside `WitsV3System`
   itself (`run.py`, APScheduler — no Docker required), plus a matching
   `self_repair` task added to the Docker-only `BackgroundAgent` dispatcher for
   deployment parity.
7. **New config section** `self_repair` in `core/config.py`/`config.yaml`:
   `enabled`, `daily_schedule_enabled`, `daily_schedule_cron`, `max_issues_per_run`,
   `log_scan_lines`, `restart_after_fix` (default `false`), `test_timeout_seconds`.

**Tests:** `tests/core/test_safe_code_editor.py` (9), `tests/tools/test_self_repair_tools.py` (8),
`tests/agents/test_self_repair_agent.py` (12, rewritten), `tests/agents/test_advanced_coding_agent.py`
(5, new), `tests/tools/test_file_tools.py` (2, new — locks in the path-guard fix),
`tests/agents/test_background_agent.py` (+2), `tests/test_run_self_repair_schedule.py` (5, new).

**Known limitations / honest next steps** (not done here — good follow-ups):

- The LLM is asked for a **full corrected file**, not a diff/patch — reliable for
  small-to-medium files, but large files risk truncation or an expensive
  regeneration. A diff-based apply path would scale better.
- `diagnose_log_errors` only resolves file/line from a real Python traceback
  (`Traceback (most recent call last): ... File "...", line N`). Bare
  `ERROR`/`CRITICAL` log lines without a traceback are surfaced but marked
  non-actionable — nothing tries to guess a file for those.
- FAISS/neural/Supabase memory backends never wired `_prune_if_needed()`-style
  hooks into their own `add_segment`, and likewise nothing here extends
  self-repair awareness into those backends specifically (out of scope — `basic`
  is the configured default).
- Process restart is still the same blunt `subprocess.Popen` + process-exit
  primitive that predates this work — ungraceful for the uvicorn web-server path
  (no in-flight-request draining). Fine for a CLI/dev restart; a production
  supervisor process would be a better foundation if this needs to be graceful.
- `restart_after_fix` defaults to `false` for the *scheduled* daily run
  specifically so it can never surprise someone using the app live; it's fully
  wired and tested, just off by default.

## 2. Recommended next work (prioritized)

### P0 — Verify & promote

1. Complete manual tests A–F on `fix/revive-2026-07` / `cursor/iron-delta-w0r5`.
2. Merge `fix/revive-2026-07` → `main` when satisfied.

### P1 — High leverage (code)

| Item | Why | Effort |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Orchestrator result synthesis guard** | Logs still occasionally show answers that ignore tool observations; add explicit post-tool check or synthesis prompt tightening | Medium |
| **Expand CI lint** | CI runs critical ruff only; pre-commit has full ruff/black/isort but ~124 black files / ~3.7k ruff findings in legacy code block full CI enforcement | Medium (incremental) |
| **Friendlier Ollama-down in CLI** | Web UI has `web/user_errors.py`; CLI still surfaces raw connection errors | Small |
| **Conversation export UX** | Save-to-file works via orchestrator; add a one-click "Export chat" button or slash command in web UI | Small–Medium |

### P2 — Structure & hygiene (second-pass splits)

Files still over the 500-line rule (excluding archived GUI):

| Lines | File | Suggestion |
|------:|------|------------|
| 690 | `tools/enhanced_reasoning.py` | Split reasoning strategies vs. prompt builders |
| 680 | `core/tool_composition.py` | Split composition engine vs. registry glue |
| 649 | `tools/neural_web_visualization.py` | Split render/export from graph queries |
| 631 | `core/neural_memory_backend.py` | Split persistence vs. query/index |
| 614 | `agents/self_repair_handlers.py` | Split handler mixins by repair category |
| 603 | `tools/neural_web_nlp.py` | Split NLP ops from visualization helpers |
| 570 | `core/content_fallback_system.py` | Evaluate: wire up or archive if unused |
| 567 | `core/response_parser.py` | Split format-specific parsers |
| 531 | `core/knowledge_graph.py` | Split graph ops from serialization |
| 527 | `core/enhanced_mcp_adapter.py` | Split transport vs. tool mapping |
| 525 | `core/memory_manager.py` | Split backend factory from segment CRUD |
| 513 | `core/concrete_meta_reasoning.py` | Split meta-reasoning steps |

**Already under 500:** `llm_driven_orchestrator.py` (494), `wits_control_center_agent.py` (399), `web/server.py` (343).

### P3 — Features (when P0–P2 are boring)

| Feature | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Scheduled background tasks UI** | Visibility into `BackgroundAgent` jobs | Read-only status page first |
| **Memory browser in web UI** | Inspect/search/prune segments without CLI | Builds on existing memory APIs |
| **Multi-session chat history** | Named sessions, resume later | Needs session store + UI |
| **Tool usage analytics** | Which tools fire, latency, failure rate | Log aggregation or lightweight metrics |
| **MCP server health dashboard** | Connection state, last error, restart | Extend `/mcp` page |
| **Local model pull helper** | Web UI button to `ollama pull` missing models | Reduces "model not found" friction |
| **Document upload via web** | Drag-drop into `documents/` + ingest | Complements folder drop |
| **Streaming tool progress** | Richer SSE for long tool runs | Better UX for search/RAG |

### P4 — Neural web (only if actively using it)

The neural web stack is **wired** (tools register, backend optional) but is not
the primary user-facing path today. Before investing here, decide whether neural
web remains a product direction or a research artifact.

If continuing: see historical ideas in
[`neural-web-roadmap.md`](neural-web-roadmap.md) — concept clustering, adaptive
learning, Docker tool execution — but treat that doc as **2025-era design**, not
current priority.

---

## 3. Remove, archive, or simplify (redundancy & defunct)

### Code — candidates for archive or deletion

| Item | Verdict | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `core/adaptive_llm_interface.py` | **Archive or delete** | Marked dormant; routes to non-existent on-disk "modules". Replaced by `core/model_router.py`. Safe to move to `planning/archive/` after confirming no imports in hot path |
| `planning/archive/gui/` (PyQt6) | **Keep archived** | Web UI is permanent replacement; do not revive unless explicit new requirement |
| Supabase memory backend + MCP | **Park / optional trim** | No active Supabase project; backend code can stay for opt-in users but remove from default docs/examples. `supabase-mcp` already removed from default `data/mcp_tools.json` |
| `core/content_fallback_system.py` | **Audit usage** | 570 lines; grep for callers — archive if nothing in production path uses it |
| `core/cognitive_architecture*.py` remnants | **Audit** | May overlap with enhanced reasoning; consolidate or archive |
| Root-level duplicate configs | **Done** | pytest.ini, mypy.ini, etc. already removed (Tier 1) |

### Documentation — consolidate to reduce confusion

| Document | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| **`suggested-features-2026-07.md`** (this file) | **Canonical forward roadmap** |
| **`revival-2026-07.md`** | **Canonical history + shipped log** — keep, but do not duplicate "what's next" here |
| **`composer-orchestrator-search-quality-2026-07.md`** | **Historical handoff** — keep for manual test plan A–F and Tier 1–4 audit detail; marked superseded for "what's next" |
| **`neural-web-roadmap.md`** | **Historical** — 2025 design; header already flags this |
| **`planning/tasks/task-management.md`** | **Supersede** — 2025 phases; redirect to this file |
| **`TASK.md`** | **Redirect only** — point here + revival doc |
| **Synthetic brain doc set** (`docs/SYNTHETIC_BRAIN.md` + archives) | **Keep with historical headers** — canonical entry is `docs/SYNTHETIC_BRAIN.md` |

### Config / deps — optional cleanup

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| `config.yaml` `supabase:` section | Keep but document as optional; ensure README says "skip if unused" |
| `requirements.lock` still lists `supabase` | Keep for optional backend; or move to `[optional]` extra |
| Gmail MCP entry in `data/mcp_tools.json` | Remove if not planning to connect; harmless config-only today |
| `.cursorrules` PLANNING.md pointer | Verify still points at `planning/architecture/system-architecture.md` |

---

## 4. Parked (explicitly out of scope)

Do **not** start these unless requirements change:

- **Docker packaging** — no container story yet; local dev + web UI is the path
- **Supabase cloud sync** — no project; backend remains opt-in code only
- **PyQt6 desktop GUI** — archived; web UI + PWA is the client
- **Git submodules for MCP servers** — replaced by on-demand clone (`scripts/clone_mcp_servers.py`) + registry `npx`/`uvx`/`docker run`
- **Phase 2 "Neural Web" as primary product** — research direction only until explicitly prioritized

---

## 5. Quick reference — document map

```

├── suggested-features-2026-07.md   ← YOU ARE HERE (what's next)
├── revival-2026-07.md              ← what shipped + error triage log

```

**Workflow:** implement on feature branch → push/merge to `fix/revive-2026-07` → manual test → Richard merges to `main`.

---

## 6. Suggested sprint order (if picking one chunk)

1. **Day 1:** Manual tests A–F + promote to `main` if green.
2. **Day 2–3:** Orchestrator synthesis guard + CLI Ollama-down errors.
3. **Week 2:** Incremental ruff/black cleanup (10–20 files per PR) until CI can run full lint.
4. **Week 3+:** Second-pass 500-line splits starting with `enhanced_reasoning.py` and `tool_composition.py`.
5. **When bored:** Web export button, memory browser, document upload.

*When this doc goes stale, update the header date and reconcile against `git log fix/revive-2026-07` and `pytest --collect-only`.*
