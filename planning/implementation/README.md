# WitsV3 Implementation Documentation

This directory contains implementation details and summaries for WitsV3 features.

## Core Implementation Documents

- **[personality-ethics-network-implementation.md](personality-ethics-network-implementation.md)** - Personality, ethics, and network control implementation
- **[claude-evolution-prompt.md](claude-evolution-prompt.md)** - Claude evolution prompt details
- **[adaptive-llm-design.md](adaptive-llm-design.md)** - Adaptive LLM design and implementation

## Implementation Highlights

### Personality & Ethics System

The personality system allows WitsV3 to adapt its behavior based on user-defined personality profiles, while the ethics framework ensures operations adhere to core principles like human wellbeing and truthfulness.

### Adaptive LLM System

The adaptive LLM system dynamically routes queries to specialized models based on complexity and domain, with semantic caching for improved performance.

### Claude Evolution Integration

Implements multi-phase integration with Claude models, including specialized prompting, context management, and tool usage capabilities.

## Document Guidelines

- Document specific implementation details and design decisions
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Cross-reference with architecture documents
- Update when implementation changes
