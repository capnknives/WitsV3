# WitsV3 Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for various features and improvements in the WitsV3 project. These plans provide structured approaches to development, including task breakdowns, timelines, and technical specifications.

## Backlog Clearance Plan

The primary focus of the current implementation plans is the backlog clearance effort, which is organized into four phases:

1. **Phase 1: Critical Fixes** (June 12-15, 2025)
2. **Phase 2: Complete Neural Web** (June 15-23, 2025)
3. **Phase 3: Core Enhancements** (June 20-26, 2025)
4. **Phase 4: New Features** (June 26-July 9, 2025)

### Key Documents

- [**Backlog Clearance Master Plan**](backlog-clearance-master-plan.md) - The central coordination document for the backlog clearance effort, including task prioritization, dependencies, and implementation strategy.
- [**Backlog Clearance Progress Tracking**](backlog-clearance-tracking.md) - Detailed tracking of task status, completion metrics, and issues encountered during implementation.
- [**Phase 1 Implementation Plan**](backlog-clearance-phase1.md) - Detailed plan for critical fixes (June 12-15, 2025).
- [**Phase 2 Implementation Plan**](backlog-clearance-phase2.md) - Detailed plan for completing the Neural Web (June 15-23, 2025).
- [**Phase 3 Implementation Plan**](backlog-clearance-phase3.md) - Detailed plan for core enhancements (June 20-26, 2025).
- [**Phase 4 Implementation Plan**](backlog-clearance-phase4.md) - Detailed plan for new features (June 26-July 9, 2025).

## Implementation Plan Structure

Each implementation plan follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the plan's focus and objectives.
2. **Timeline** - Start date, end date, and duration.
3. **Tasks** - Detailed breakdown of tasks, including implementation steps, code examples, and testing requirements.
4. **Implementation Schedule** - Timeline for each task with assigned owners.
5. **Success Criteria** - Measurable criteria for determining when the implementation is complete and successful.
6. **Dependencies** - Other components or tasks that this implementation depends on.
7. **Risks and Mitigations** - Potential risks and strategies to mitigate them.
8. **Next Steps** - Actions to take after completing the implementation.

## Using These Plans

Implementation plans should be used as follows:

1. **Reference for Development** - Developers should refer to these plans for technical specifications and implementation details.
2. **Progress Tracking** - Use the tracking document to update task status and report issues.
3. **Coordination** - Team leads should use these plans to coordinate work across team members.
4. **Quality Assurance** - QA should use the success criteria to verify that implementations meet requirements.

## Contributing to Implementation Plans

When creating or updating implementation plans:

1. Follow the established structure for consistency.
2. Include detailed technical specifications and code examples where appropriate.
3. Define clear, measurable success criteria.
4. Identify dependencies and risks.
5. Update the tracking document as tasks progress.
