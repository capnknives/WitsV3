# Backlog Clearance Progress Tracking

This document tracks the progress of the WitsV3 backlog clearance effort. It provides a detailed view of task status, completion metrics, and any issues or blockers encountered during implementation.

## Overview

The backlog clearance is organized into four phases:

1. **Phase 1: Critical Fixes** (June 12-15, 2025)
2. **Phase 2: Complete Neural Web** (June 15-23, 2025)
3. **Phase 3: Core Enhancements** (June 20-26, 2025)
4. **Phase 4: New Features** (June 26-July 9, 2025)

For the complete implementation plan, see [Backlog Clearance Master Plan](backlog-clearance-master-plan.md).

## Daily Updates

### 2025-06-11
- Created comprehensive backlog clearance plan
- Developed detailed implementation plans for all four phases
- Identified critical path and dependencies
- Established progress tracking mechanism
- Updated TASK.md to reflect current progress
- Completed "Backlog Clearance Plan Implementation" task (marked as completed in TASK.md)
- Moved "Fix memory pruning issue" task to Active Tasks section (started early)

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks on June 12, 2025
2. Daily check-ins to track progress and address blockers
3. Weekly review of the overall plan to make adjustments as needed
4. Prepare for Phase 2 kickoff on June 15, 2025
