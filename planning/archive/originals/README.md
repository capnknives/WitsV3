# Original Documentation Files

This directory contains the original documentation files from before the reorganization. These files are kept for historical reference only and should not be used as current documentation.

## Background

In June 2025, the WitsV3 documentation was reorganized into a more structured format:

- Documentation was categorized into dedicated directories (architecture, implementation, roadmap, tasks, technical-notes)
- Files were given consistent metadata and formatting
- Related information was consolidated where appropriate

The files in this directory are the original versions as they existed before this reorganization.
