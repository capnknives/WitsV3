# Evolution Priority 2: Intelligent Tool Composition & Workflow Engine

## Overview
Transform WitsV3's tool system from isolated execution to intelligent composition with automatic workflow generation, optimization, and adaptive execution strategies.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Tool Composition Engine
```python
class ToolCompositionEngine:
    """
    Intelligently compose tools into workflows based on goals
    """
    
    async def analyze_goal_requirements(self, goal: str) -> ToolRequirements:
        """Determine what tools/capabilities are needed"""
        pass
    
    async def generate_workflow(self, requirements: ToolRequirements) -> Workflow:
        """Generate optimal tool execution workflow"""
        pass
    
    async def optimize_workflow(self, workflow: Workflow) -> OptimizedWorkflow:
        """Optimize for parallel execution and efficiency"""
        pass
    
    async def adapt_workflow_runtime(self, workflow: Workflow, results: IntermediateResults) -> Workflow:
        """Adapt workflow based on intermediate results"""
        pass
```

### 2. Advanced Tool Registry
```python
class SmartToolRegistry:
    """
    Enhanced tool registry with capability mapping and composition rules
    """
    
    async def auto_generate_tool(self, specification: str) -> Tool:
        """Generate new tools from natural language specifications"""
        pass
    
    async def discover_tool_combinations(self, goal: str) -> List[ToolChain]:
        """Discover effective tool combinations for goals"""
        pass
    
    async def learn_from_execution(self, execution: ToolExecution) -> None:
        """Learn from tool execution patterns to improve future recommendations"""
        pass
    
    async def suggest_missing_tools(self, failed_goal: str) -> List[ToolSpecification]:
        """Suggest tools that would help achieve failed goals"""
        pass
```

### 3. Workflow Execution Engine
```python
class WorkflowExecutor:
    """
    Execute complex tool workflows with monitoring and adaptation
    """
    
    async def execute_parallel(self, tasks: List[ToolTask]) -> List[ToolResult]:
        """Execute independent tasks in parallel"""
        pass
    
    async def execute_conditional(self, workflow: ConditionalWorkflow) -> WorkflowResult:
        """Execute workflows with conditional branching"""
        pass
    
    async def monitor_execution(self, workflow_id: str) -> ExecutionMetrics:
        """Real-time monitoring of workflow execution"""
        pass
    
    async def handle_tool_failure(self, failure: ToolFailure) -> RecoveryStrategy:
        """Intelligent failure handling and recovery"""
        pass
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. Tool Capability Mapping
```yaml
# tools/capability_map.yaml
tools:
  python_execution:
    capabilities:
      - code_execution
      - data_processing
      - algorithm_implementation
    inputs: [code, variables]
    outputs: [result, stdout, stderr]
    
  web_search:
    capabilities:
      - information_retrieval
      - fact_checking
      - current_events
    inputs: [query, filters]
    outputs: [results, sources]
```

### 2. Workflow Templates
```python
class WorkflowTemplate:
    """Pre-defined workflow patterns for common tasks"""
    
    research_workflow = [
        ("web_search", {"query": "{topic}"}),
        ("parallel", [
            ("file_read", {"path": "references.txt"}),
            ("python_execution", {"code": "analyze_sources({results})"})
        ]),
        ("summarize", {"content": "{all_results}"})
    ]
```

### 3. Tool Generation Framework
```python
class ToolGenerator:
    """Generate new tools from specifications"""
    
    async def parse_specification(self, spec: str) -> ToolSchema:
        """Parse natural language tool specification"""
        pass
    
    async def generate_implementation(self, schema: ToolSchema) -> str:
        """Generate tool implementation code"""
        pass
    
    async def validate_and_test(self, tool: Tool) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate and test generated tool"""
        pass
```
