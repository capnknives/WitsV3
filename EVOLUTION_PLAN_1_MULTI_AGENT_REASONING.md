# Evolution Priority 1: Advanced Multi-Agent Reasoning & Collaboration System

## Overview
Transform WitsV3 into a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration platform with meta-reasoning, backtracking, and collaborative problem-solving capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Meta-Reasoning Layer
```python
class MetaReasoningEngine:
    """
    Engine that reasons about reasoning - plans how to plan
    and monitors agent performance.
    """
    
    async def analyze_problem_space(self, goal: str) -> ProblemSpace:
        """Analyze the problem to determine optimal approach"""
        pass
    
    async def generate_execution_plan(self, problem_space: ProblemSpace) -> ExecutionPlan:
        """Create multi-agent execution plan with contingencies"""
        pass
    
    async def monitor_execution(self, plan: ExecutionPlan) -> ExecutionMetrics:
        """Monitor plan execution and adapt in real-time"""
        pass
```

### 2. Agent Collaboration Framework
```python
class CollaborationProtocol:
    """
    Defines how agents communicate and collaborate
    """
    
    async def negotiate_task_distribution(self, agents: List[Agent], tasks: List[Task]) -> TaskAssignment:
        """Agents negotiate optimal task distribution"""
        pass
    
    async def share_context(self, from_agent: Agent, to_agents: List[Agent], context: Context):
        """Share relevant context between agents"""
        pass
    
    async def consensus_decision(self, agents: List[Agent], options: List[Option]) -> Decision:
        """Multiple agents reach consensus on decisions"""
        pass
```

### 3. Backtracking & Recovery System
```python
class BacktrackingOrchestrator:
    """
    Orchestrator with ability to backtrack and try alternative approaches
    """
    
    async def checkpoint_state(self) -> StateCheckpoint:
        """Save current execution state"""
        pass
    
    async def evaluate_progress(self) -> ProgressMetrics:
        """Determine if current approach is working"""
        pass
    
    async def backtrack_to_checkpoint(self, checkpoint: StateCheckpoint):
        """Restore to previous state and try alternative"""
        pass
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Create `core/meta_reasoning.py` with base abstractions
2. Implement `ProblemSpace` and `ExecutionPlan` schemas
3. Add checkpoint/restore capability to orchestrator
4. Create tests for meta-reasoning components

### Phase 2: Collaboration Protocol (Week 2)
1. Implement `agents/collaboration_manager.py`
2. Create inter-agent communication channels
3. Add context sharing mechanisms
4. Implement consensus algorithms

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
1. Update `LLMDrivenOrchestrator` with meta-reasoning
2. Add multi-agent support to control center
3. Create specialized collaborative agents
4. Comprehensive integration testing

## Performance Targets
- 40% improvement in complex problem-solving
- Support for 5+ concurrent agent collaborations
- <100ms overhead for meta-reasoning decisions
- 95% success rate in backtracking recovery

## Risk Mitigation
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Extensive testing of edge cases
- Fallback to single-agent mode
- Performance monitoring and optimization
