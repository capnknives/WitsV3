# WITS Synthetic Brain Implementation - Remaining Tasks

## Overview

We've successfully committed the Phase 1 implementation of the WITS Synthetic Brain expansion plan. This document outlines the remaining tasks that need to be addressed in the next work session.

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Existing Implementation Issues

- [ ] Fix syntax error in `core/cognitive_architecture.py`
- [ ] Address missing `export_memory` function in `core/memory_export.py`
- [ ] Fix indentation error in `core/memory_summarization.py`
- [ ] Resolve dependencies for testing (faiss/numpy compatibility issues)

### 2. Complete Test Implementation

- [ ] Fix test dependencies for all test files
- [ ] Complete remaining test cases for memory handler
- [ ] Complete remaining test cases for cognitive architecture
- [ ] Setup proper mocking for external dependencies

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

- [ ] Complete integration with existing memory systems
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with LLM interfaces
- [ ] Integrate with knowledge graph
- [ ] Connect with tool registry

### 4. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Add more detailed usage examples
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Update main README with synthetic brain information

## How to Continue

1. Start by fixing the immediate code issues identified during testing
2. Address the remaining modified files that weren't included in the commit:
   - `core/config.py`
   - `core/memory_manager.py`
   - `core/memory_summarization.py`
   - `planning/tasks/task-management.md`
   - `test_enhanced_streaming.py`
3. Decide on the approach for the untracked files (whether to include or ignore them)

## Next Implementation Milestone

After addressing these issues, we should begin implementing Phase 2 of the expansion plan:
- Input Stream Embodiment
- Simulated Output System
- Initial sensorimotor integration

## Testing Strategy

- Fix the numpy/faiss dependency issues
- Use a test-driven development approach for the remaining components
- Create integration tests that verify compatibility with existing systems
- Use mocks for components that aren't fully implemented yet

## Resource Management

Keep track of performance metrics and resource usage as we add more components:
- Memory usage
- Processing time
- Storage requirements
- Embedding dimensions
