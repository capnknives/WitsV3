# WitsV3

A streamlined, LLM-wrapper based AI orchestration system.

## Overview

WitsV3 is designed for maximum flexibility and LLM-driven decision making. It focuses on a CLI-first approach with a modular design to allow for future expansion (e.g., Web UI, advanced Book Writing System).

## ✅ Current Status - FULLY OPERATIONAL

WitsV3 has been successfully implemented and tested with the following features working:

- **Tool Registry**: 6 tools properly registered and functional
- **LLM Integration**: Successfully connects to Ollama with llama3 model  
- **Memory Management**: Proper datetime serialization and JSON handling
- **Agent System**: LLM-driven orchestrator with ReAct pattern implementation
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and directory listing capabilities
- **Unicode Support**: Clean text output without character encoding issues

This version prioritizes:

- LLM Wrapper Architecture
- Core agent system (Control Center, Orchestrator)
- Essential memory management (with optional FAISS-GPU)
- Extensible tool system, including MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Langchain integration capabilities

## Key Features (Planned/In-Progress)

- **LLM-Driven Orchestration:** Leverages the power of LLMs for task decomposition and execution planning.
- **WitsControlCenterAgent (WCCA):** User interaction and goal clarification.
- **OrchestratorAgent:** ReAct-style loop for managing tasks.
- **Memory Management:** Persistent memory with semantic search capabilities.
- **MCP Tools:** Dynamically created and managed tools based on LLM descriptions.
- **Langchain Integration:** Ability to leverage Langchain tools and functionalities.
- **CLI First:** Robust command-line interface for interaction and development.
