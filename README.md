# WitsV3

A streamlined, LLM-wrapper based AI orchestration system.

## Overview

WitsV3 is designed for maximum flexibility and LLM-driven decision making. It focuses on a CLI-first approach with a modular design to allow for future expansion (e.g., Web UI, advanced Book Writing System).

- Core agent system (Control Center, Orchestrator)
- Essential memory management (with optional FAISS-GPU)
- Extensible tool system, including MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Langchain integration capabilities
- Adaptive LLM capabilities for optimized resource usage
- **Production-grade test coverage and stability**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama (with models like Llama3, CodeLlama, etc.)
- Other dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/capnknives/WitsV3.git
cd WitsV3

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Run tests to verify installation
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Running WitsV3

```bash
# Start the CLI interface
python run.py

# Run background agent
python -m agents.background_agent

# Run specific tests
pytest tests/tools/test_json_tool.py -v
```

## Adaptive LLM System

WitsV3 includes a sophisticated Adaptive LLM System that dynamically routes queries to specialized modules based on complexity and domain, with semantic caching for improved performance.

Key components:

- **ComplexityAnalyzer**: Analyzes query complexity and domain to route to appropriate modules
- **DynamicModuleLoader**: Manages specialized LLM modules with VRAM/RAM budgeting and quantization
- **SemanticCache**: Stores and retrieves patterns based on semantic similarity
- **AdaptiveLLMInterface**: Main interface that integrates all components

Benefits:

- **Resource Efficiency**: Uses appropriate-sized models based on query complexity
- **Domain Specialization**: Routes to domain-specific modules for better responses
- **Performance Optimization**: Caches common patterns and responses
- **Adaptive Quantization**: Uses lower precision for simple queries, full precision for complex ones

## Test Suite Status 🧪

WitsV3 maintains a comprehensive test suite with **93.3% pass rate**:

- ✅ **Background Agent Tests** (5/5) - Scheduler, task execution, monitoring
- ✅ **Configuration Tests** (8/8) - Pydantic validation, YAML loading
- ✅ **JSON Tool Tests** (7/7) - Data manipulation, file operations
- ✅ **Math Tool Tests** (7/7) - Statistics, probability, matrix operations

- ✅ **Tool Integration Tests** (12/12) - Web search, file operations

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Quick test run
pytest tests/ --tb=no -q
```
